- **Interoperable:** An interconnected network of drones
- **Mesh:** Peer to peer communication 
- **Wireless:** No cables are available in the sky
- **Ad-hoc:** Peer to peer communication while reacting to frequent changes in the network
- **Network for:** A connection of nodes for communication
- **Triangulating:** Finding the correct position from several nodes
- **Emergencies with:** Helps in urgent situations with no room for failure
- **Decentralized:** The network can communicate and store information without a central hub
- **Drones:** Drones can access areas inacessible to people

## Introduction

People are lost in avalanches and landslides every year. The areas that are left behind these natural disasters are very unsecure and dangerous to traverse. Saving people that are under several layers of snow, dirt or stone therefore requires expertise. Expertise that takes time to gather to a single spot. As the areas are hard to traverse, it takes a lot of time to search even with years of experience. Even with expertise and experience there is still danger just exposing people to these open hazards.

IM-WANTEDD provides the simulation necessary to understand how these emergencies can be solved in the best possible way; with no lives lost. It is created through the subject IDATT2104 - Network Programming at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Drones are put over a landscape and communicate together in a mobile wireless mesh network.
