## Theory

### Mesh networks

#### Flooding

### Ad-hoc networks

### Vanet and Fanets
Manet is a network of mobile nodes which can connect and disconnect at will and Vanet is the subset that is specilized for vehicles. Vanets provides high node mobility. Fanet is a subset of Vanet used for flying vehicles like planes and UAVs. These networks can be used in a combination of several different network topologies like centralized, decentralized, multigroup or multilayer. (Suescun, 2016).

### Half Duplex
In wireless networks, data can be sent both ways, but only one way at a time. This is called half duplex. It is in contrast of full duplex used in wired transmission where data can be sent both ways at the same time (Burke, 2019).

### RTS/CTS

The protocol for RTS/CTS can be used in half duplex connections primarily for hidden-node problem. It avoids collsions in packets by first sending a request to send a message. If it recieves a clear to send message, it can send the message. If it does not recieve a clear to send message, it will wait a random amount of time before sending a new request to send message. The time delay before sending a new request needs to be random to avoid creating a collision with another node's request continuously (Ols√∏, 2017).


### DSRC

DSRC is a vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure protocol used in Vanet. With datarates in the megabits and a range of up to 1000 meters, it helps vehicles send updated information about traffic and emergencies. There are differences between countries, but the standards in the different regions follow the same principal. DSRC uses a frequency around 5.9GHz with a bandwith of tens of megahertz depending on the region. A small bandwith helps to exclude noice which might generate from the waves' interaction with the environment (Hadded, 2015).

To avoid anyone intercept this network, HMAC can be used to authenticate messages with performance which will affect the networks delay's minimally. The delay, security and delivery ratio is dependent on the hash key size (Khare, 2020).



### Triangulation

### Decentralization


### Avalanche Beacons
