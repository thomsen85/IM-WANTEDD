> A mobile wireless mesh network simulation for rescue missions using drones.

IM-WANTEDD is a simulation program written in Rust with Bevy, designed to visualize and simulate a mobile wireless mesh network for rescue missions. The simulation includes a network of drones that communicate with each other to triangulate the position of nearby beacons. The program aims to provide an interactive and realistic environment to study and analyze the behavior of the network in realistic scenarios.

## Features

- Simulates a mobile wireless mesh network with drones for rescue missions.
- Realistic visualization and simulation of drone movements and communication.
- Dynamic network topology with decentralized communication.
- Support for various routing and flooding techniques.
- Easy-to-use interface for controlling and monitoring the simulation.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. Refer to the [Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for installation instructions.

2. Clone the IM-WANTEDD repository:
